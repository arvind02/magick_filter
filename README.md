# MagickFilter

This Gem is an attempt to build Ruby Gem and release it to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org). If you want to convert your photo with some cool filters, you are at right place. This Gem is in early stage. I'll keep on adding some more filters and features with time.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'magick_filter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install magick_filter

## Usage

In present there are three filters available in this Gem. Use the given below commands on console to convert photos.


### Original Image

<img src="/test_image/test.jpg" alt="Original"/>


### For Sketch Filter

**`MagickFilter::Tool.process(image_path, "sketch")`**


<img src="/test_image/sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch"/>


### For Gold Filter

**`MagickFilter::Tool.process(image_path, "gold")`**


<img src="/test_image/gold.jpg" alt="Gold"/>


### For Poster Filter

**`MagickFilter::Tool.process(image_path, "poster")`**


<img src="/test_image/poster.jpg" alt="Poster"/>


### For Bright Filter

**`MagickFilter::Tool.process(image_path, "bright")`**


<img src="/test_image/bright.jpg" alt="Bright"/>


### For Black & White Filter

**`MagickFilter::Tool.process(image_path, "bw")`**


<img src="/test_image/black&white.jpg" alt="Black & White"/>


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
