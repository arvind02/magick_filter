# MagickFilter

This Gem is an attempt to build Ruby Gem and release it to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org). If you want to convert your photo with some cool filters, you are at right place. This Gem is in early stage. I'll keep on adding some more filters and features with time. 

This Gem is based on [Image Magick](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/), So please make sure that you have image magick installed on your system. 



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'magick_filter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install magick_filter
